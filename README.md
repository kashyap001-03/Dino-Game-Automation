# Dino-Game-Automation
I used image processing technique for Dino Game automation of Google chrome. Make some rectangle apart from the Dino to tackle with tress and crows in path set some values(length,breath) of rectangle with set's color values. Basically whenever trees or palnts comes towards to the dino the rectangle that apart at some distance from dino it's sense and tackle and countine.
And one thing I m working on that Google chorme Dino game that's mainly appers when your internet connection loss and start Game In Google chorme.
